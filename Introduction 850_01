I am Monica and am a 2nd year student in the QQPM Program (in the Educational Psych Department). I have dabbled in several statistical programs (SPSS, SAS, MPlus, & R) but lack the fundamental programming understanding to know what I am doing. I am very excited to be in this class. 
I am originally from the Washington, D.C. area and have only been in Nebraska since 2018.While I miss some of the diversity of the east coast, I have really enjoyed the lack of traffic and the beautiful prairies here in Nebraska. I have a cat named Esby (pronounced "Ez' bee") who I love beyond measure. I am also an avid birder and drive all over the place looking for birds to photograph (poorly) with my Nikon P1000 zoom camera.
